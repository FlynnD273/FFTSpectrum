# FFTSpectrum
Converts an audio file into an array of frequency values.

Download [this](https://github.com/FlynnD273/FFTSpectrum/tree/master/FFTSpectrum/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1) folder. The exe is the application, and it needs the dll files in the same directory.

Right-click on a wav file (MUST be \*.wav for now) and select "open with" click on "more programs" and navigate to wherever you downloaded this program. Select the exe file. When prompted, enter the settings for the output file. Press enter without typing anything to leave the values as default. For [this project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/409444777/) I used all the default settings, but set the framrate to 15, half of Scratch's target framerate. This should create a text file in the same directory as the wav file you selected. Go to [this Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/409444777/) and right click on the list called \_frequencies and select "Import" choose the text file that was generated. You should be able to convert a file at a full 30 FPS, as long as you don't try to save the Scratch project. You might be able to save if you have faster internet than me, and that's not hard to do.
